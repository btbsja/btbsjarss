Police say Rowan Baxter was found dead nearby from self-inflicted wounds. Ms Clarke died in hospital later from severe burns. </p><p>Witnesses said she had jumped out of the car screaming that he had poured petrol on her. </p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51565803" class="story-body__link">Ex-rugby player 'senselessly murdered' family </a></li></ul><p>It later emerged that Ms Clarke - who was originally reported as going by the surname Baxter - had repeatedly sought police help over domestic violence and had secured court orders.</p><p>The reports sparked anger about some of the media treatment of the incident. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Victim-blaming at its worst'</h2><p>In a news conference on Thursday, Det Insp Thompson had suggested it could not be assumed the case was straight forward and that it was investigators' job "to keep a completely open mind". </p><p>He appealed for anyone with information about the family to come forward. </p><p>"We need to look at every piece of information and, to put it bluntly, there are probably people out there in the community that are deciding which side to take, so to speak, in this investigation," he said.</p><p>"Is this an issue of a woman suffering significant domestic violence and her and her children perishing at the hands of the husband, or is this an instance of a husband being driven too far by issues that he's suffered, by certain circumstances, into committing acts of this form?"</p><p>Commissioner Carroll told ABC Radio Brisbane that the comments were "victim-blaming at its worst" and offered her sincere apologies to the community and victims.</p><p>"The phraseology was completely wrong, and the words and way it was said should not have been used."</p><p>She said Det Insp was "an exceptionally good police officer" and was "distressed" by the impact of the comments, but that "we want to remove the noise and concentrate on the issue". </p><p>"So, the issue is there is a murder, there is a mother and three children who have been murdered. And I want to concentrate on that." </p>
