He has also been fined $20,000 (£15,500) and must serve 250 hours of community service. </p><p>He will not have to report to prison until the judge rules on a pending defence appeal. </p><img class="media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p0843tn7.jpg" /><br /><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/embed/p0843sv5/51580160">使用浏览器播视频/view video in browser</a><p>Stone's sentence fell short of an initial seven- to nine-year recommendation from prosecutors. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What did the judge say?</h2><p>Speaking in her Washington DC court on Thursday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had engaged in "threatening and intimidating conduct" towards her.</p><p>She said Stone "knew exactly what he was doing" when he posted an image on social media last year of a gun's crosshairs next to her head.</p><p>Stone had claimed he thought the crosshairs were a Celtic cross.</p><figure><img alt="The image of Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Roger Stone posted to Instagram" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/600/cpsprodpb/1579/production/_110979450_stonerpost.jpg" /><br /><figcaption>Stone said he thought the crosshairs actually depicted a Celtic cross ©Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>"This is intolerable to the rule of justice," she said. "The court cannot just sit idly by and say 'that's just Roger being Roger.'" </p><p>Judge Jackson also said Stone "was not prosecuted for standing up for the president, he was prosecuted for covering up for the president".</p><p>She continued: "The dismay and disgust at the defendant's belligerence should transcend party."</p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a class="story-body__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47002918">Roger Stone: Trump ally and Russia probe defendant</a></li></ul><p>"At his core, Mr Stone is an insecure person who craves and recklessly pursues attention." </p><p>She said the politics surrounding the case did not inform her ultimate decision. </p><p>"The truth still exists. The truth still matters," she said. </p><img class="media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05x9fh1.jpg" /><br /><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/embed/p05x9621/51580160">使用浏览器播视频/view video in browser</a><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What politics was the judge referring to?</h2><p>After prosecutors last week recommended a sentence of seven to nine years, Mr Trump tweeted that such a prison term would be "very horrible and unfair".</p><p>The Department of Justice then swiftly said it planned to reduce the amount of prison time sought for Stone.</p><ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a class="story-body__link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51469717">Prosecutors quit Roger Stone case over dispute</a></li></ul><p>This led all four prosecutors on the case to quit, one leaving the justice department entirely. </p><p>On Thursday, Judge Jackson called the justice department intervention "unprecedented". </p><figure><img alt="Roger Stone" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/600/cpsprodpb/C45B/production/_110976205_gettyimages-1138660281.jpg" /><br /><figcaption> ©Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What did Stone's lawyer say?</h2><p>The defendant's attorney, Seth Ginsberg, said that despite his client's image as a "dirty trickster", he was a spiritual man, devoted to his family.  </p><p>"Mr Stone is, in fact, not simply that public persona, but a human being," he said.</p><p>Mr Ginsberg had argued that Stone should get no prison time.</p><p>Stone declined to speak at Thursday's hearing. Wearing sunglasses and a dark fedora, he entered the courthouse flanked by his wife, family and friends.</p><p>He walked past several protesters, one of whom shouted "traitor". </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How did President Trump respond?</h2><p>Speaking in Las Vegas, Nevada, after the sentencing, the Republican president defended Stone. </p><p>He indicated no immediate plans to pardon Stone, but said "at some point I'm going to make a determination".</p><p>Mr Trump said: "I'd love to see Roger exonerated, and I'd love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly."</p><p>"It is my strong opinion that the forewoman of the jury is totally tainted," Mr Trump also said. "She was an anti-Trump activist." </p><p>Awaiting Stone's sentencing, Mr Trump sent a tweet that seemed to question his ally's conviction while listing a host of perceived enemies.</p><div class="social-embed"><div class="social-embed-post social-embed-twitter">
